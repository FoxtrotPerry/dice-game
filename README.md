# ðŸŽ² Dice Game ðŸŽ²

This game goes by name names (Farkle, Greed, Hot Dice, Zonk, Zilch, Dice 10k, 5-Dice, just to name a few). In my house, it was just called "Dice" and as such, the repo is just as creatively named.

This particular app is a score keeper and rule book for my family's rendition of the classic 5 die game.
