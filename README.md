# üöß V2 Under Construction üöß

V2 of [fivedicegame.com](https://fivedicegame.com) aims to maintain the existing functionality of the original and add some missing features that will make playing the game even more effortless!

## V2 Additional Features ‚öôÔ∏è

- [x] **User Authentication**  - Users can create accounts and log in to save their games and preferences.
- [x] **Game Caching** - Any ongoing game is saved locally automatically and can be restored when you revisit the site.
- [x] **Game History** - Users can view their past games and see generated stats based on what occurred during the game.
- [ ] **Autofill Players** - Do you typically play with the same group? If so, you can save that preset to use it whenever you start a new game. No more typing in everyone's name every time!

## Why?

I wanted to try my hand at making a game runner that would be intuitive enough to use with little to no instruction, but feature rich enough to allow users
familiar with the UI to quickly do all the sorts of things that they would expect a runner like this to be capable of.

From a software engineering perspective, this project has served as a proving ground for all sorts of new techniques and technologies that I have been wanting to try out. You'll find some clean code in this repo that I'm happy with, but right alongside it you might also find remnants of a failed experiment or some practices that aren't considered paradigmatic. There exist a few design decisions that I'm still on the fence about or have marked for re-writes. All in due time!
